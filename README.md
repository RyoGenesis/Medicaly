# Medicaly

<h3><b>Medicaly</b> is an e-commerce web application-based platform for pharmacies to sell medicines and medical devices online easily by registering their pharmacies on our website once verified. Users can buy these items online without going to a pharmacy and have additional features by asking for prescription recommendations from experts (specialist doctors) online by filling out forms.<h3>
